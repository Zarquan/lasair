Lasair is a broker for astronomers studying transient and variable astrophysical sources.
It is being developed as a collaboration between the
<a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/>University of Edinburgh</a> and
<a href=http://www.qub.ac.uk/>Queen's University, Belfast</a>
to build a broker service for alerts generated by the 
<a href=https://www.lsst.org/>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>. 
We are planning to serve LSST transient alerts to the LSST user community and combine 
these data with value-added cross-matches against existing catalogues and analysis tools.
</p><p>
To help prototype the functionality needed to process alerts from LSST, 
Lasair is currently ingesting and presenting alerts from the public stream of the 
<a href=http://www.ztf.caltech.edu>Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>,
which is releasing a transient alert stream in a format similar to that envisaged for LSST. 
We thank ZTF for access to this valuable public data stream. 
Lasair provides a broker system for users to access, visualise and extract science data. 
The capabilities of Lasair will develop incrementally, guided by user feedback, so please
