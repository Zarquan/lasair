Lasair is a broker for astronomers studying transients and variables. 
It is being developed as part of the 
<a href=https://www.lsst.ac.uk/>LSST:UK </a>
Phase A programme through a 
collaboration between the 
<a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/>University of Edinburgh</a> and
<a href=http://www.qub.ac.uk/>Queen's University, Belfast</a>
with funding from grants ST/N002512/1 and ST/N002520/1, respectively. 
To help prototype the functionality needed to process alerts from LSST, 
Lasair is currently ingesting and presenting alerts from the public stream of the 
<a href=http://www.ztf.caltech.edu>ZTF</a> survey.
Its capabilities will develop incrementally, guided by user feedback, so 
please try it and tell us what more you need to do your science.
</p><p>
You can query the alerts by selecting "Query ZTF" at the left, 
you can see the coverage of the ZTF survey each night,
and you can -- with a login -- query the database through a <a href= http://jupyter.org/>Jupyter</a> notebook interface.
</p><p>
Lasair started ingesting ZTF on 28 May 2018, and now has {{ n_candidates }} candidate alerts.
