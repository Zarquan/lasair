Lasair is a broker for astronomers studying transient and variable astrophysical sources.
It is being developed as a collaboration between the
<a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/>University of Edinburgh</a> and
<a href=http://www.qub.ac.uk/>Queen's University, Belfast</a>
to build a broker service for alerts generated by the 
<a href=https://www.lsst.org/>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>. 
We are planning to serve LSST transient alerts to the LSST user community and combine 
these data with value-added cross-matches against existing catalogues and analysis tools.
</p><p>
To help prototype the functionality needed to process alerts from LSST, 
Lasair is currently ingesting and presenting alerts from the public stream of the 
<a href=http://www.ztf.caltech.edu>Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>,
which is releasing a transient alert stream in a format similar to that envisaged for LSST. 
We thank ZTF for access to this valuable public data stream. 
Lasair provides a broker system for users to access, visualise and extract science data. 
The capabilities of Lasair will develop incrementally, guided by user feedback, so please 
try it and tell us what more you need to do your science -- use the <i><b>Contact</b></i> link.
</p><p>
You can query the alerts with a freeform SQL interface (select <i><b>Query Objects</b></i>).
The <i><b>Cone Search</b></i> finds an object by position.
You can see the coverage of the ZTF survey each night (click <i><b>Coverage</b></i>).
A <i><b>Watchlist</b></i> is a collection of sky positions that you find interesting, and
Lasair can do cone searches on all of these together.
Power users can use a <a href= http://jupyter.org/>Jupyter</a> notebook interface, 
click <i><b>Jupyter</b></i> for more information and to see the capabilities.
</p><ul>

<li>Each ZTF alert is an information package that includes a rich set of parameters for 
candidate transient or variable objects. These are assimilated into <i>objects</i> and users can 
query on any column from the candidate or object table -- see 
<a href=/schema.html>here</a> for schema.</li>
<li>Some functions of this website require a login. If you want to use these functions, use the "login/signup" links
at the top left of this page.</li>
<li>Questions and enquiries, please click <i><b>Contact</b></i>. Make suggestions for improvements and fixes at the 
<a href="https://github.com/lsst-uk/lasair/issues">Lasair github issues page</a>.</li>
<li>Lasair started ingesting ZTF on 28 May 2018, and now has {{ n_candidates }} candidate alerts.</li>
<li>You may wish to use other brokers that have the ZTF stream: 
<a href=https://mars.lco.global/>MARS</a> from Las Cumbres Observatory, or 
<a href=https://antares.noao.edu/>Antares</a> from NOAO Tucson.
<li>The word "lasair" means flame or flash in Scots and Irish gaelic. It is pronounced <i>lassa</i>. 
More accurately, listen <a href="https://forvo.com/word/lasair/">here</a> 
or <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fuaim/lasair">here</a>.</li>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/conesearch.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/conesearch.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Conesearch</b>: You can copy and paste a position from <a href=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/>Astronomer's Telegram</a> or elsewhere to see if Lasair has a light curve for that source.  </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/objectpage.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/objectpage.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Rich Object Information</b>: The light curve of each object is shown in two 
filters (g and r), with both detections and non-detections, in this case for 
supernova <a href=https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018jny>2018jny</a> / 
<a href=https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF18acsovsw/>ZTF18acsovsw</a>. 
Comments can be added by logged-in users, such as this one with the link to the IAU name
of the supernova. The Sherlock classificaiton system has provided information about the
host galaxy. 
<a href=https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/>Aladin Lite</a>
provides both images and catalogue sources: here we see 
<a href=https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/>Pan-STARRS</a> image of the host galaxy with sources from 
Pan-STARRS and <a href=https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/>Gaia DR2</a>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/detectionsandnondetections.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/detectionsandnondetections.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Detection Images</b>: The object page has links to detailed information about each observation
that makes up the light curve, with images, in this case for 
<a href=https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF18acsovsw/>ZTF18acsovsw</a>. 
We see the brightening of 
<a href=https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018jny>2018jny</a>. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/sharedqueries.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/sharedqueries.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Rich Query Capability</b>: Lasair provides free-form SQL query access to the database. 
Available tables include the ZTF objects and candidates (detections), as well as the
classification of the object from Sherlock and the comment list. Logged-in users can
contribute useful queries which can then be re-used by others.</td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/watchlist.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/watchlist.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Watchlists</b>: A watchlist is a collection of sources in the sky that can be created 
by a logged-in user, that can be private or public. The "Run Crossmatch" button searches the
Lasair database for transients coincident with any of those sources. Here we see a
catalogue of Cataclysmic Variables (left side of the table), and the associated 
Lasair sources (right side). The inset shows the light curve foe one of the CVs. </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/coverage.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/coverage.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Coverage</b>: The coverage of the survey can be seen against a variety of all-sky images from 
<a href=https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinLite/>Aladin Lite</a>. Green squares are for g 
filter (401.5–551.9 nm) and red squares for r filter (552.0–691.0 nm). </td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="/lasair/static/img/sherlock.png"><img width=200 style="border: 2px blue solid;" src="/lasair/static/img/sherlock.png"></a></td>
<td><b>Sherlock Classification</b>: The <a href=https://qub-sherlock.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>Sherlock</a> system crossmatches every Lasair transient against many catalogues, classifying it,
and producing a natural-language assessment of the object, that is available on the object page. </td></tr>
