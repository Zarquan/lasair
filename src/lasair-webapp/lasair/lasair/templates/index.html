Lasair is a broker for astronomers studying transients and variables. 
It is being developed as part of the 
<a href=https://www.lsst.ac.uk/>LSST:UK </a>
A programme through a 
collaboration between the 
<a href=https://www.ed.ac.uk/>University of Edinburgh</a> and
<a href=http://www.qub.ac.uk/>Queen's University, Belfast</a>.
To help prototype the functionality needed to process alerts from LSST, 
Lasair is currently ingesting and presenting alerts from the public stream of the 
<a href=http://www.ztf.caltech.edu>ZTF</a> survey.
Its capabilities will develop incrementally, guided by user feedback, so 
please try it and tell us what more you need to do your science.
</p><p>
You can query the alerts with a freeform SQL interface (select <i><b>Query Objects</b></i>).
The <i><b>Cone Search</b></i> finds an object by position.
You can see the coverage of the ZTF survey each night (click <i><b>Coverage</b></i>).
A <i><b>Watchlist</b></i> is a collection of sky positions that you find interesting, and
Lasair can do cone searches on all of these together.
Power users can use a <a href= http://jupyter.org/>Jupyter</a> notebook interface, 
click <i><b>Jupyter</b></i> for more information and to see the capabilities.
